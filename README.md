# Hard-Sphere-Monte-Carlo

## Introduction

Written for first year BCFN students at the University of Bristol as part of the compuatational nanoscience course. 

This code is to be used in conjunction with: https://github.com/tranqui/monte_carlo .The code here is an aid for students still very new to programming in python and does not use any advanced python features and libraries. Students with prior experience of python may find the [this repository](https://github.com/tranqui/monte_carlo) more educational.

## What to Do

There are four steps towards a successful Monte-Carlo simulation  of hard spheres.

1. Simulating a random gas with the periodic boundary condition (PBC).
2. Simulating repelling hard spheres with PBC.
3. Simulating attracting hard spheres with PBC.
